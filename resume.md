## Projects

- Movie Recommendation System based on Twitter Followers
  - Used ImdbPy to get Movie Names and its associated attributes like actors, ratings, box office collections etc.
  - Used K-Means clustering to cluster the movies based on user ratings, critic ratings and box-office collection.
  - Skills: Python (Twitter SDK, scikit learn, pandas, IMDBPy) 
- Cricket Match Result Predictor
  - K-means clustering was used to cluster the players in the following way [Data Scraped from espncricinfo.com]
    - For Batsman: Strike Rate,Average,Runs Scored,Fours,Sixes.
    - For Bowlers:  Economy, Bowling Average, Bowling Strike Rate, Wickets.
  - Batsman Bowler performance was analyzed using two approaches. The first approach was a probabilistic approach and the second one involved a decision tree approach and the outcome of each model was predicted and compared, on a single node hadoop cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
  - Skills: Python, Hadoop-HDFS, PySpark, Scikit Learn, GCP. 
- Custom Key Management System (KMS) drive with Hewlett Packard Enterprises
  - Built a custom KMS using AES Standard Keys (AES256).
  - The KMS performs server encryption and manages the data keys. It also supported the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) feature.
  - Skills: AWS (EC2 Instances, AWS Application Load balancer), python-flask, python-cryptography library.

## Research Projects
- Enhancing Spatial Join Algorithm with Grid Sub-Partitioning
  - Implemented a modified spatial join algorithm with Grid Sub-Partitioning in order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm by discarding the non-contributing Sub-Partitions in the filtering phase.
  - Recommend an optimum Grid Size for Sub-Partitioning based on the spatial attributes of the input data sets.
  - Tools: Python, open street map APIs
based on the spatial attributes of input data sets
  - Paper filed in IEEE  Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets conference that is currently under review.
- Scalable solution for detecting Land Usage and Land Cover changes
  - Modifying the join operation offered in spatial hadoop to scale as the size of the datasets increases.
  - The join operation performance was observed on 3 , 5 , 7 node clusters and for three kinds of spatial datasets (points, lines and polygonal datasets )
  - Tools: Hadoop, Spatial Hadoop, Java, Python
